/**
 * This file is part of the ePNK project (Petri Net Kernel for eclipse). The ePNK
 * is platform for Petri net tools based on the PNML transfer format. Its
 * main idea is to provide generic Petri net types which can be easily plugged
 * in and a simple generic GMF editor, that can be used for graphically editing
 * nets of any plugged in type. Additional functionality can be plugged in.
 * 
 * Note that this project is still in an experimental phase, and is also used
 * as a case study for EMF/GMF based Model-based Software Engineering.
