# TimedStateMachine

This modeling example is about timed state machines - a simple language to be realized in about 120 minutes.
So it is a good fit to show how a DSML can be implemented in one lecture. 

In the repository you will find a presentation for realizing the DSML step-by-step and all the necessary Eclipse projects. 

The example has been developed by Tanja Mayerhofer and Manuel Wimmer @ TU Wien in 2018.
